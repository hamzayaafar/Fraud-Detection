I began by cleaning the data, making sure to eliminate any null and invalid points. After that, I completed different calculations and visualization in order to determine which columns were redundant or unnecessary and which ones were important. I proceeded to remove the redundant columns and then did a train/test split on the data. I coded a logistic regression analysis and decision tree since I felt they applied contextually to the dataset.
