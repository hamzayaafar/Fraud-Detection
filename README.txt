This code is an analysis of an approximately 500mb CSV dataset representing banking transactions and whether they were fraudulent. My goal for this was to use different libraries and toolkits to find a way to accurately analyze this dataset and then predict whether a certain transaction would be fraudulent based on its others characteristics.
I began by cleaning the data, making sure to eliminate any null and invalid points. After that, I completed different calculations and visualization in order to determine which columns were redundant or unnecessary and which ones were important. I proceeded to remove the redundant columns and then did a train/test split on the data. I coded a logistic regression analysis and decision tree since I felt they applied contextually to the dataset.
